  <p>Hey I'm Matthew, but I go by handeyeco when I'm making things.</p>
  <p>I do a lot of things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm a programmer by day</li>
    <li>I enjoy organizing communities</li>
    <li>I make art sometimes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I paint</li>
      <li>I make music</li>
      <li>I code digital art</li>
      <li>I take photos</li>
      <li>I repurpose found objects</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm also passionate about encouraging an open society. My personal code is usually Open Source and my art is usually Creative Commons. I work for a non-profit education company.</p>
  <p>I try to work against censorship and towards dismantling the theocracy. I believe knowledge will set us free.</p>
  <p>I promise this site will be better before the Maker Faire.</p>
